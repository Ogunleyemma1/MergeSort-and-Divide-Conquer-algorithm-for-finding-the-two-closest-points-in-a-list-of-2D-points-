# MergeSort-and-Divide-Conquer-algorithm-for-finding-the-two-closest-points-in-a-list-of-2D-points-
* Implement the sorting algorithm Merge Sort, which you will have to use in the algorithm for solving Closest-Points. It should sort 2D points by either their x-coord. or y-coord dependent on its input parameters
* Implement the presented Divide & Conquer algorithm for finding the two closest points in a list of 2D points
